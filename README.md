# AnimationCircle

### CSS animation is a feature of CSS that allows you to animate a change in one or more style properties of an element, 
### as well as control various aspects of the animation.

#### Animation properties:
--> @keyframes
--> animation-name
--> animation-duration
--> animation-delay
--> animation-iteration-count
--> animation-direction
--> animation-timing-function
--> animation-fill-mode
--> animation

In this Project I was using this properties:
(animation-name, animation-duration, animation-iteration-count, @keyframes).
